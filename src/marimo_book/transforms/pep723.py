"""Notebook dependency analysis: PEP 723 generation + WASM micropip bootstrap.

Two jobs:

1. **PEP 723 generation** — walk a notebook's AST, collect its imports,
   map module names to PyPI distributions, and write a
   ``# /// script`` inline-metadata block (the format read by ``uv run``,
   ``marimo --sandbox``, molab, and any other PEP-723-aware tool).
   Build-time staging writes the block into a sibling copy of the
   notebook; ``marimo-book sync-deps`` writes it back into the source.

2. **WASM micropip bootstrap** — for pages rendered through
   ``MarimoIslandGenerator`` (WASM mode), provide the pieces of an
   islands JSON payload (marimo >= 0.24, marimo-team/marimo#9987) that
   installs pure-Python PyPI-only deps before any user cell runs:
   :func:`micropip_bootstrap_code` is the body of an extra, DOM-less
   payload cell that ``await micropip.install([...])``s the derived
   dependency list and defines a sentinel variable;
   :func:`thread_bootstrap_sentinel` prefixes every user cell's payload
   code with a bare reference to that sentinel, so marimo's dataflow
   analyzer schedules the bootstrap strictly first. The islands JS
   bundle auto-loads Pyodide-bundled packages via
   ``loadPackagesFromImports`` but only honours a PEP 723 block at column
   zero of the notebook file it synthesizes from cell bodies — which it
   never carries over from the source — so without this the install
   never happens (see marimo-team/marimo#9778). The payload is assembled
   in :mod:`marimo_book.transforms.wasm`; the executed/staged notebook
   source is never touched for this.

Uses marimo's own internals so the mapping stays in sync with marimo:

- ``marimo._runtime.packages.module_name_to_pypi_name`` — the same
  mapping table marimo uses for its own micropip fallback resolution.
- ``marimo._utils.scripts.read_pyproject_from_script`` — the PEP 723
  parser.
- ``marimo._utils.scripts.wrap_script_metadata`` — adds ``# `` prefixes
  to TOML lines.
