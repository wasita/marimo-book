# Changelog

All notable changes to `marimo-book` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **WASM tables and math are readable in dark mode.** marimo stripes island
  tables with its Radix colour scales, which are scoped `.marimo .dark` and so
  never pick up the `dark` class on `<body>`: odd rows stayed a near-white
  `--lime-2` under the dark scheme's white text. Island markdown tables and
  DataFrames now stripe with Material's tokens, matching static pages. Math
  was near-black on every dark WASM page: marimo typesets it inside each
  `<marimo-tex>` shadow root, whose own `.marimo` wrapper pins the light
  foreground, out of reach of page CSS. The shim now adopts a one-rule
  stylesheet into each root so math takes the colour of the text around it.

- **A dropped PyPI request no longer breaks a WASM page.** The micropip
  bootstrap fetches PyPI-only packages (e.g. `seaborn`) on every page load and
  tried once: if that request failed, every cell importing the package showed
  `ModuleNotFoundError` until the reader refreshed, and the real cause was
  printed to a hidden cell. The install is now retried up to three times
  (backing off 1 s, then 2 s), and a final failure goes to stderr.

## [0.1.47] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **WASM widgets no longer sit empty while the kernel starts.** marimo's
  islands runtime captures an island's DOM after the shim has hydrated it and,
  when the kernel starts, re-inserts that serialized copy. The copy kept
  `data-mb-hydrated="1"`, so the shim skipped it, but canvases don't survive
  serialization: every widget on DartBrains' MR_Physics showed as an empty box
  from kernel start (~7 s) until the live widget drew, often 10 s or more.
  Hydration is now tracked in a `WeakSet`, copies marimo inserts are rendered
  again, and a widget's cleanup runs once its mount leaves the page so old
  render loops stop drawing into detached canvases. (#135)

## [0.1.46] — 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Widgets no longer vanish when a WASM page's kernel comes up.** The shim
  paints each anywidget from its baked state at load; when Pyodide is ready,
  marimo's islands runtime repaints the island and the baked mount is replaced
  by a live `<marimo-anywidget>` that stays empty until its module arrives from
  the kernel (250–900 ms per widget on DartBrains' MR_Physics), so readers saw
  every widget load, disappear, and come back while the text below jumped.
  `holdBakedFrames` puts the replaced mount back as an inert overlay and keeps
  the island's height until the live widget has drawn (two frames later; an
  8 s cap), without touching the live element. (#133)

## [0.1.45] — 2026-09-19

### Added

- **Assignments straight from the grader.** A book-level `grader:` section
  (`server`, `course`, `term`) lets a TOC entry name its assignment by slug —
  `assignment: glm` — and the build fetches the notebook the grader currently
  publishes (`{server}/a/{course}/{term}/{slug}/student.py`) into
  `.marimo_book_cache/assignments/` instead of a copy committed into the book.
  The grader is the single source of truth: a republish reaches the site on
  the next build with nothing to commit, and a new term is one line in
  `book.yml`. When the grader cannot be reached the build uses the cached copy
  and `check` says so; with no copy it fails rather than publish a page whose
  assignment is missing. A committed path still works as before. The
  assignment card gains an *Open in molab* link to the grader's molab alias,
  so the same published notebook opens in molab, in the drawer, or locally.
- **`sync-deps` writes `[tool.grader]` into every chapter's block** from the
  same `grader:` section, so a notebook opened in molab or on a laptop knows
  which grader, course and term it belongs to without any of that hardcoded
  in the notebook (`write_pep723_block(tool=...)`; idempotent; other
  `[tool.*]` tables are left alone).

## [0.1.44] — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **The header repository link sits with the other header buttons.** 0.1.43
  appended it, which put it to the *right* of the search box, while the launch
  buttons have always been inserted to the left. Which of the two supplies a
  book's header octocat depends on `launch_buttons.github`, so the same glyph
  landed on a different side of the search box from one book to the next —
  marimobook.org (launch button, left) against marimograder.org (repo link,
  right). Both mounts now anchor on the search slot, and a test asserts they
  keep agreeing.

## [0.1.43] — 2026-09-17

### Added

- **A link to the book's repository in the header.** `repo:` already reached
  mkdocs as `repo_url`, but Material renders that as a source card carrying
  star and fork counts fetched from the GitHub API, and `extra.css` hides the
  card because those counts lag reality and mislead. The side effect was that
  nothing in the header linked to the repository: the only GitHub icon came
  from `launch_buttons.github`, which points at the *current page's* source and
  is absent on a book that turns the launch buttons off. marimograder.org set
  `repo:` and had no way to reach its own source. A plain icon-only link now
  sits where Material's card would have, reading its URL out of the hidden
  element so nothing new is plumbed through `mkdocs.yml`. It appears if and
  only if `repo:` is set, and yields to a GitHub launch button when the page
  already has one, so no existing book gains a second octocat.

## [0.1.42] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **`check` warns when a workbench page's dependencies constrain their
  version.** marimo installs a notebook's script-metadata dependencies by
  *name* in the browser — `strip_requirement_name` drops the specifier before
  micropip sees it (marimo-team/marimo#10870) — so the reader gets whatever the
  bare name resolves to, which is the newest *stable* release. dartbrains asked
  for `nltools==0.6.0.dev2`, readers got 0.5.1, which needs `numpy<1.24`, has
  no Pyodide wheel, and failed to install; the chapter could not boot and the
  build said nothing. The check evaluates the block the build actually stages
  (same `dependencies.pin`, and the notebook's own block wins the merge), skips
  requirements whose environment markers exclude the browser, and reports once
  for the book rather than once per page. Flagged: `==`, `===`, `~=`, upper
  bounds, and a lower bound naming a pre-release — which selects the newest
  stable just as an exact pin does. Not flagged: ordinary lower bounds, and URL
  requirements, which survive the strip intact.
### Fixed

- **Notebooks follow the palette toggle.** A `mode: wasm` page rendered its
  cells light on a dark page, and an open edit frame kept whichever theme it
  booted with — flipping the palette left a white editor sitting in a dark
  article. Two causes, both upstream. marimo's islands entry point never mounts
  `ThemeProvider`, so nothing puts the `dark` class on `<body>` that every
  colour token in the bundle resolves through: islands dark mode was not stale,
  it was unreachable. And marimo decides its theme once — the islands theme atom
  sniffs the DOM with no reactive dependency, the embedded editor reads `?theme=`
  and `config.display.theme` at mount — so a host that changes its own theme has
  no way to say so.

  `marimo_book.js` now keeps `<body>`'s `dark` class and `data-theme` in step
  with Material's `data-md-color-scheme`, and the workbench relays palette
  changes into its frame over `postMessage`. Both then write
  `data-vscode-theme-kind`, the one theme input marimo recomputes after boot
  (a MutationObserver feeds the atom that overrides the inferred theme), which
  re-themes what CSS cannot reach: CodeMirror's syntax colours, the data
  tables' canvas, Vega and mermaid. The frame is re-themed in place, so no
  Pyodide reboot and no lost kernel state.

  marimo also reads that attribute's mere presence as "running inside the VS
  Code extension" and hides two data-table controls, so it is written only once
  the scheme actually changes under a booted page — a reader who never toggles
  keeps the full table UI. `notes/marimo-islands-theme-upstream.md` is the
  issue to file for a first-class hook that would let the attribute go.

## [0.1.41] — 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **`dependencies` no longer stales committed `_rendered/` bodies.** The
  rendered-body signature hashed the whole `dependencies` model, so adding a
  `dependencies.overrides` entry — a knob that only retargets the generated
  PEP 723 block, which micropip reads *in the browser* — marked every
  `mode: cached` page stale and forced it to re-execute. In dartbrains that is
  a 46 GB re-download in `Download_Data` for no change in output. Under
  `mode: env` (the default) the notebook runs in the environment that invoked
  the build, so only the mode itself is hashed now; under `mode: sandbox` the
  generated block *is* the environment and every field still counts. The
  irrelevant fields are pinned to their defaults rather than dropped, so a
  book that never set them sees no hash change at all. Same over-broad hashing
  0.1.40 fixed for `defaults.views` / `hide_author_line`.
- **`pyarrow` joins polars in not warning.** It ships in the Pyodide release
  marimo pins (22.0.0), checked against the lockfile the same way.
- **`check` no longer claims polars can't run in the browser.** It ships a
  wheel micropip installs, and computes fine in Pyodide — verified in a
  browser, which is now the standard the list documents, since "has native
  code" plainly isn't it.

### Changed

- **The molab button carries marimo's mark** instead of a stand-in rocket —
  the sketched circle from marimo's logotype, inlined as a `currentColor` path
  so it takes the palette's foreground and lines up with the GitHub and
  download glyphs beside it. molab's own logo is a colour illustration rather
  than a glyph, so it cannot be a `currentColor` path and looked out of place
  in a monochrome row.
- **Docs: the workbench and the assignment drawer each have a live demo.**
  *Workbench demo* is a static page offering Read / Run / Edit, with cells
  worth editing and a tour of History; *Assignment demo* is an ordinary
  static page — no `views` — that still carries an assignment, showing that a
  chapter readers cannot run can still carry one they can. They replace the
  sample that was bolted onto the WASM demo page, which conflated two features
  and ran two Pyodide kernels on one page.

## [0.1.40] — 2026-09-15

### Added

- **In-browser workbench: `views: [read, run, edit]`.** A notebook page can
  now offer, next to its rendered `read` view, marimo's own editor mounted
  in the page (`run` opens the app-like present view, `edit` the full
  editor). The editor is self-hosted with the site — marimo's frontend
  bundle is copied under `_workbench/` once per marimo version, ~27 MB, only
  when some page lists `run` or `edit` — and loads in a same-origin
  `<iframe>`, so the page's own CSS and the editor's never meet. Edits
  autosave into the reader's browser (IndexedDB) as a local copy of the
  published notebook with a version history: a History drawer with named
  versions, rolling checkpoints (`workbench.checkpoint_minutes` /
  `max_checkpoints`), diff preview, restore, reset-to-published and delete;
  a republish is detected by a build-time content hash and offered as an
  update (undoable, both sides snapshotted) rather than applied over the
  reader's work. Read / Run / Edit, a copy-status chip and History sit in
  the Material header next to the launch buttons; the state rides in
  `?view=` so it survives reloads. `open_in` picks the initial view; with
  a single view no control is rendered. `marimo-book check` errors on an
  `open_in` outside `views` or on `views` set on a Markdown page, and warns
  when a workbench notebook imports a package with no Pyodide wheel. Two
  marimo behaviours are worked around in the runtime and documented in
  `workbench.py`: the save flow needs a filename, and marimo's save worker
  drops the PEP 723 header on save (re-attached from the published base so
  a reboot still installs the notebook's packages). See the new
  *Workbench* guide; the docs' WASM demo page dogfoods it.
- **Assignments in a drawer: `assignment:` on a TOC entry.** Point a page
  at the *student* notebook a grader published (a committed file for now;
  a synced grader listing later) and the page ends with an assignment card
  — title, grader identity and question headings read from the notebook
  itself — whose *Open assignment* (or the header's **Assignment** toggle)
  slides a bottom drawer up: the assignment in its own editor, with its own
  local copy and history, under a bar with status, a grader sign-in chip
  (the grader's device flow, sharing the widget's token), History,
  Minimize and Hide. The drawer is drag-resizable, keeps its kernel alive
  across minimize/hide, remembers its state per page, and the chapter
  keeps scrolling above it — so a student reads the chapter and works the
  assignment on one page. The assignment is never merged into the chapter:
  what a student submits stays byte-for-byte what the grader published plus
  their answers. `check` errors on a missing or non-notebook assignment
  file and warns when it has no PEP 723 block. The docs' WASM demo page
  carries a sample. A grader widget's `marimo-grader:submitted` DOM event
  (marimo-grader-client ≥ 0.1.1) is relayed to the page, which records the
  submission as a version in the assignment's History.

### Changed

- **`defaults.hide_author_line` now does what it says.** The knob has been
  declared and documented since the first release (*"Lines of the form
  `*Written by ...*` in the first Markdown cell are stripped"*) but nothing
  read it, so bylines rendered regardless. It is implemented now, default
  `true` as documented, across every render mode: Markdown prose, marimo's own
  HTML (a composite `mo.vstack` cell), and WASM pages — where the strip has to
  happen in the source the islands runtime executes, since those pages
  re-render their prose in the browser. Only the first fully-italic
  `Written by …` paragraph of a notebook page is removed; prose that merely
  mentions an author, later bylines, and hand-written `.md` pages are left
  alone. **If your book shows bylines and you want to keep them, set
  `hide_author_line: false`** — otherwise the next build will drop them.

### Fixed

- **Prose from a composite cell ran together on static pages.** marimo renders
  `mo.vstack([mo.md(...), mo.image(...), ...])` itself — the documented way to
  mix prose and figures — and emits each paragraph as an inline
  `<span class="paragraph">`, blocking it in its own stylesheet. Static pages
  never load that stylesheet (only WASM pages do, through the islands bundle),
  so every paragraph of such a cell rendered on one line, byline included.
  `extra.css` now blocks them.

## [0.1.39] — 2026-09-13

### Added

- **Opt-in zensical build shell.** `shell: zensical` in `book.yml` (or
  `marimo-book build/serve --shell zensical`) runs
  [zensical](https://zensical.org), Material for MkDocs' Rust successor, on
  the same generated `mkdocs.yml` instead of `mkdocs`. Builds this repo's
  docs in ~0.6 s with byte-identical page bodies, working WASM islands,
  anywidgets, and the full `extra.css` theme (verified against 0.0.62).
  Needs `marimo-book[zensical]`. The generated config points zensical at
  `_site_src/site/` (it rejects any `site_dir` outside its project root and
  panics on absolute paths) and the CLI mirrors the result to `_site/`, so
  deploy workflows are unchanged. `mkdocs` stays the default: zensical is
  pre-1.0 and **silently drops** the plugins behind `social_cards`, `blog`,
  `check_external_links` and `pdf_export` — `marimo-book check` now errors
  on those combinations. Status and blockers tracked in #105.

## [0.1.38] — 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **`mo.md` prose on WASM pages rendered as escaped HTML.** marimo ships
  `mo.md` output under the `text/markdown` mime with the *rendered* HTML as
  the payload (it picks that mime so its frontend sanitises the markup).
  The mime-renderer pass added in 0.1.31 (#91) treated every
  `text/markdown` payload as plain text and wrapped it in a `<pre>`, so
  each prose cell of a `mode: wasm` chapter showed `<span class="markdown
  …">` soup until the Pyodide kernel repainted it — and 0.1.37 (#102) only
  rescued anywidgets inside that wrapper. A payload that is markup now
  passes through as HTML (an escaped tag is unescaped first); genuine
  markdown source renders through the same Python-Markdown stack as the
  page body. Seen on dartbrains' MR Physics, Signal Processing and
  Preprocessing chapters.
- **A dependency bump left the build cache stale.** The build cache keyed
  cached bodies on the notebook source, `book.yml` and the marimo-book
  version only, so pages whose source was untouched kept the anywidget
  JS and state baked by the *previous* package versions (dartbrains' ICA
  viewer after an nltools upgrade). The signature now also hashes the
  book's dependency lock file (`uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`,
  `Pipfile.lock`, `pixi.lock` or `requirements.txt`, first found in the
  book root). Committed `_rendered/` bodies are deliberately unaffected —
  refresh those with `marimo-book render`.

### Added

- **Precompute controls show the widget's `label=`.** A literal `label`
  kwarg on a precomputed `mo.ui.slider`/`dropdown`/`radio`/`switch` is
  carried into the widget metadata and replaces the generic "Adjust:"
  prefix on the static control (`data-label` on the mount).

## [0.1.37] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **anywidgets inside `mo.vstack`/`mo.hstack` rendered as escaped text.**
  marimo emits a widget placed in a container as a `<marimo-mime-renderer>`
  whose `text/markdown` payload is the *escaped* `<marimo-anywidget>` markup.
  The mime-renderer pass added in 0.1.31 (#91) turned that into a `<pre>` of
  angle brackets instead of a mount — the same text/markdown downgrade the
  top-level path already handled. Escaped marimo custom elements are now
  unescaped so the anywidget pass rewraps them (dartbrains' Connectivity and
  ICA component viewers).

## [0.1.36] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Images inside `<iframe srcdoc>` were downscaled**, which garbles viewers
  that slice a sprite mosaic by fixed pixel geometry (nilearn's
  `view_img`/brainsprite): the 0.1.35 image pipeline resized the embedded
  sprite to `max_width` and every slice landed in the wrong place. Images
  referenced from a `srcdoc` attribute are still compressed to WebP and
  de-duplicated, but keep their pixel dimensions.

## [0.1.35] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **Build-time image compression and externalization** (`images:` in
  `book.yml`, on by default). Every inline `data:image/*` URI — matplotlib
  PNGs, `mo.image()` files, nilearn mosaics, and on WASM pages the same
  outputs again inside marimo's islands payload — is decoded once per unique
  payload, re-encoded to WebP (lossy or lossless, whichever is smaller; alpha
  preserved), downscaled above `max_width` (1600 px), written once to
  `assets/img/<sha256>.<ext>` and referenced with `loading="lazy"`,
  `decoding="async"` and intrinsic `width`/`height`. SVG/GIF pass through but
  are externalized and de-duplicated; data URIs inside fenced code blocks are
  left verbatim. Files ride the same content-addressed cache as anywidget
  buffers (`.marimo_book_cache/img/`, `_rendered/img/`), are staged into
  `docs/assets/img/` at finalize time (cache hits and precompute splices
  included), and cache/committed entries are invalidated when a file is
  missing. Bodies keep site-root-relative URLs; `_finalize_page` localizes
  them for the page's directory URL. Pillow becomes a core dependency.
  `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` bumped to `8`. On dartbrains the heaviest page
  (60 figures, 32 MB of inline PNG, half of it duplicated) is the motivating
  case.

## [0.1.34] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- **Precompute still flagged anywidget cells as reactive via `IPY_MODEL_`
  references.** ipywidgets' `layout`/`style` traits point at sibling models
  as `IPY_MODEL_<id>` inside `data-initial-value`, and those ids are minted
  per export like the mount's own. `_diff_key` masks them too; on
  dartbrains' Connectivity chapter the lookup table shrinks from nine
  "reactive" cells to the one the slider actually drives.

## [0.1.33] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- **Precompute flagged every anywidget cell as reactive.** marimo mints a
  fresh model id per export for each anywidget (and the
  `<marimo-ui-element object-id/random-id>` wrapper), so two renders of an
  unchanged widget cell never compared equal in `_diff_key` and the whole
  cell — now including its baked buffers — was copied into the lookup table
  once per slider value. The diff key masks those ids; real state
  differences (traits, buffer content hashes, ESM) still register.
- **Identical gzip buffers never de-duplicated.** `gzip.compress()` stamps
  the current time into the header, so the same volume produced on two
  exports hashed differently and the store kept one copy per render.
  `BufferStore` now zeroes the gzip MTIME field before hashing (a valid
  stream with the same payload); nltools' viewer volumes and any other
  gzip-compressed trait collapse to one blob per distinct payload. On
  dartbrains' Connectivity chapter this plus the model-id masking takes the
  precomputed grid from ~100 MB of volumes to roughly one per component.

## [0.1.32] — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Anywidget state is baked into static pages.** Every anywidget on a
  `mode: static` page now renders with the state the kernel actually gave
  it — synced scalar traits, binary `Bytes` traits, and `_css` — instead of
  starting from an empty model and whatever defaults its JS hard-codes.
  Data-carrying widgets that previously rendered nothing (nltools'
  `BrainData.iplot()` niivue viewer, plotly `FigureWidget`, image/array
  viewers) now render and stay interactive on the kernel-less site.
  Mechanics: `marimo export ipynb` never writes widget state, but the
  exporter holds it in `session_view.model_states`; `_export_runner.py`
  (`--states`) dumps those states to a sidecar keyed by the same `model_id`s
  the exported HTML uses (`transforms/widget_state.py` reads it). The rewriter merges scalar state into `data-initial-value`
  (precedence: `widget_defaults` < literal kwargs < recorded state), writes
  buffers once each to a content-addressed store (`.marimo_book_cache/anywidget/`
  for live renders, `_rendered/anywidget/` for `marimo-book render`) and
  references them from the mount's `data-buffers`; `_finalize_page` copies
  the referenced blobs to `docs/assets/anywidget/`. The shim fetches them
  before `render()` and hands the widget a `DataView`, matching anywidget's
  wire format. Cache hits and committed renders re-stage the blobs and are
  invalidated when a blob is missing. Serialization is best-effort: if
  marimo's `model_states` shape changes, pages fall back to the previous
  behaviour. `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` bumped to `7`.

### Fixed

- **List, dict and Altair outputs rendered as nothing on static pages** (#73).
  marimo formats a bare `list`/`tuple`/`dict` as an `application/json`
  bundle and an Altair chart as a Vega(-Lite) spec — neither has an HTML
  form — and, inside `mo.vstack` & co., as `<marimo-json-output>` /
  `<marimo-mime-renderer>` custom elements that only marimo's frontend can
  draw. The mime picker skipped the bundles and the rewriter passed the
  elements through, so the page showed code and no output. New
  `transforms/mime_outputs.py`: JSON structures become a fully static
  `<ul>` tree (marimo's `text/plain+<type>:` leaf/key markers decoded to
  Python literals; nested rich objects, `value_types`, `name` honoured);
  Vega specs become a `<div class="marimo-book-vega" data-spec>` mount that
  `marimo_book.js` hydrates with vega-embed from jsdelivr — the Plotly
  pattern — re-embedding on the light/dark toggle.
  `application/vnd.marimo+mimebundle` payloads are unpacked too. Docs:
  live Altair + dict demos on the Widgets page (`altair` added to the docs
  CI install and the `dev` extra). Bumped `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` to `6`.

## [0.1.31] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- **anywidgets rendered empty on marimo ≥ 0.24** (#79). marimo 0.24 stopped
  putting a widget's ES module on the `<marimo-anywidget>` element
  (`data-js-url`); it now travels on the kernel's `ModelOpen` notification
  (marimo-team/marimo#10127), so every mount the shim hydrated had no module
  to import — in static, precompute and WASM modes. Static pages are now
  exported by a small standalone runner (`marimo_book/_export_runner.py`)
  that mirrors marimo's own execute-then-`export_as_ipynb` path and also
  writes `{model_id: js_url}` from the session view (virtual-file URLs
  inlined as `data:` URLs); `--sandbox` wraps it with marimo's own
  `uv run --isolated` flags. WASM pages harvest the same map from the islands
  generator's session view. `rewrite_anywidget_html` restores `data-js-url`
  from the map. On WASM pages the runtime now renders anywidgets itself
  after the kernel runs (its widget registry has the module), so the shim's
  MutationObserver that rewrapped runtime-emitted widgets — which on 0.24
  only blanked a working widget — is gone, and anywidget state round-trips
  to the kernel natively. Regression tests execute a real inline anywidget
  through both paths (`tests/test_anywidget_esm.py`; `anywidget` added to the
  `dev` extra). Bumped `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` to `5`.

### Changed

- **marimo 0.24 required (and supported).** The dependency pin is now
  `marimo>=0.24,<0.25` (was `>=0.23.6,<0.24`). Verified against marimo
  0.24.1: the unit suite, the strict docs build (`marimo export ipynb` +
  `MarimoIslandGenerator`), and browser hydration of the WASM demo page
  against the `@marimo-team/islands@0.24.1` CDN bundle. The floor is 0.24
  because the WASM micropip bootstrap below rides on the islands JSON
  payload that first shipped there.
- **WASM micropip bootstrap now travels in marimo's islands JSON payload,
  not in the executed source.** Pages with PyPI-only deps get a
  `<script type="application/vnd.marimo.islands+json">` carrying marimo's own
  cell payload plus one extra, anchor-less cell that
  `await micropip.install([...])`s the install list; every user cell's payload
  code is prefixed with `_ = marimo_book_micropip_done` so marimo's dataflow
  runs the bootstrap first (the sentinel is always bound, even if the install
  fails, so a bad wheel degrades to per-cell import errors instead of
  cancelling the page). The install list is the import-derived dependencies
  merged with the notebook's own PEP 723 block (same merge as the staged
  manifest) **minus Pyodide-bundled packages** — those auto-load via
  `loadPackagesFromImports`, and a host-pinned `numpy==X` handed to micropip
  would fail. The bundled list comes from marimo's own Pyodide lockfile
  resolver (honours `MARIMO_PYODIDE_LOCK_FILE`; fetched once per Pyodide
  version and cached under `.marimo_book_cache/`; if unreadable the full list
  is installed). Pages whose imports are all bundled or marimo-only emit no
  payload. `marimo_book.js` re-hydrates anywidget/plotly mounts when the
  runtime materializes the payload (that happens after Pyodide boots, and
  would otherwise replace already-hydrated widgets with build-time markup).
  The notebook `MarimoIslandGenerator` executes is no longer rewritten for
  this (the old AST injection round-tripped every WASM page with PyPI-only
  deps through `ast.unparse`, which is what tripped the 0.1.28–0.1.30
  title-hoist bugs; the title hoist itself still stages an `ast.unparse`d
  copy for notebooks with a leading H1), and the `with app.setup:` limitation
  is gone (setup code is an ordinary cell to the islands runtime). Verified in
  a browser against marimo 0.24.1: a notebook importing a non-Pyodide package
  raised `ModuleNotFoundError` before and renders after. Bumped
  `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` to `4` so cached/committed WASM bodies re-render.
  Retiring the bootstrap entirely once marimo carries dependencies in the
  payload itself is tracked in #77.

## [0.1.30] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **WASM title-hoist now actually strips the heading.** `extract_and_strip_title`
  matched `mo.md("""...""")` with a triple-quote regex, but the WASM staging
  round-trips the source through `ast.unparse` first (for the micropip
  bootstrap), which rewrites it to a single-quoted literal with `\n` escapes —
  so the regex found nothing and the hoist silently no-op'd on every real build
  (the duplicate title persisted; only the raw-source unit test passed).
  Rewrote it to walk the AST and operate on the string *value*, immune to quote
  style. Bumped `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` to invalidate the now-incorrect cached
  bodies.

## [0.1.29] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **The 0.1.28 WASM title-hoist now actually reaches cached builds.** The hoist
  changes a notebook's rendered body, but `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` wasn't bumped,
  so the transient build cache replayed pre-0.1.28 bodies and the duplicate title
  persisted on any page whose source was unchanged. Bumped the contract version
  so cached bodies invalidate and WASM pages re-render with the hoist.

## [0.1.28] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **WASM pages no longer render a duplicated page title.** On `mode: wasm`
  pages the notebook's leading `# H1` is emitted *encoded* inside a
  `<marimo-mime-renderer>` data attribute, so MkDocs Material can't see a
  literal `<h1` in `page.content` and injects the nav title as its own
  heading — the reader saw the title twice. The WASM renderer now hoists the
  first `mo.md` cell's leading `# H1`: it strips that line from the cell
  (rendering the copy, never the source `.py`) and emits one real `<h1>` at
  the top of the page body, which Material detects and leaves alone. The
  notebook's own (often more descriptive) heading becomes the single page
  title. Notebooks whose first markdown cell doesn't begin with an ATX `# H1`
  are untouched; static/cached pages were never affected (their heading is a
  literal `<h1>` Material already sees).

## [0.1.27] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Native citations.** `bibliography: [refs.bib]` + `cite_style: apa|numbered`
  now work: pandoc-style `[@key]` / `[@a; @b]` in `.md` pages and notebook
  prose render as linked inline citations plus a per-page References section
  (a standalone `\bibliography` line controls placement). No mkdocs plugin
  and no pandoc — resolved natively in the preprocessor at finalize time, so
  editing the `.bib` never invalidates cached notebook renders. Code
  fences/spans are exempt; unknown keys stay verbatim (`check` warns on
  them and errors on missing `.bib` files).
- **`marimo-book check` is now a real doctor** (was a stub). In under a
  second, with no notebook execution: missing TOC files, missing
  logo/favicon/api_docs/blog paths, uninstalled extras for enabled features
  (with the exact pip command), stale `mode: cached` artifacts, duplicate
  staged outputs, inert config knobs (`bibliography:` until it ships,
  reserved launch-button flags), buttons-without-repo, empty sections, and
  broken relative links in `.md` sources (code fences/spans excluded).
  Errors exit 1; `--strict` promotes warnings for CI.
- **Serve/rebuild speed: the transient cache now stores pre-finalize bodies**
  (cache schema v3). Launch buttons and link rewrites are re-applied on every
  build, so TOC, title, `repo`, and `launch_buttons` edits no longer
  invalidate notebook renders; precompute results (spliced body + stats +
  warnings) are recorded and replayed on hits instead of re-exporting the
  entire widget grid on every build — previously the dominant cost of every
  `serve` rebuild. Warm-building marimo-book's own docs drops from ~5.8 s to
  ~0.9 s; books with heavier precompute grids gain proportionally more.
  Wiping `_site_src` no longer forces a re-render either — staged pages are
  reconstructed from cached bodies without executing anything.

### Fixed

- **Precomputed pages keep their launch buttons.** The splice step matched
  the button row with an exact-string marker that never fit the real markup
  (which carries a `data-placement` attribute), so books with `repo:` set
  silently lost the molab/GitHub/download row on every precomputed page.
- **`build --strict` now fails when a notebook cell raises.** Previously a
  runtime error rendered its traceback into the published page while CI
  stayed green (mkdocs strict only checks nav/links). Non-strict builds and
  `marimo-book render` warn; pages that intentionally demonstrate exceptions
  opt out with `allow_errors: true` on the TOC entry. The verdict survives
  caching: raising cells are recorded in the build cache and in `_rendered/`
  manifest entries and replayed on hits, so a cached page can't dodge the
  strict gate (artifacts rendered before this release are grandfathered
  until the next `marimo-book render`). WASM pages are exempt — the islands
  runtime re-executes in the browser. Diagnostics point at the code-cell
  ordinal (`code cell 3`), counting only code cells.
- **`defaults.execution_timeout`** (seconds, default `600`, `null` disables)
  bounds every notebook execution — `marimo export` subprocesses and the
  in-process WASM island build — a notebook stuck in an infinite loop or a
  hung download previously stalled `build`/`serve`/CI forever with no
  diagnostic. Books whose notebooks legitimately run longer should raise the
  knob (or disable it) in `book.yml`. The knob is excluded from cache and
  `_rendered/` signatures: tuning it never invalidates committed renders.
- **`marimo-book render` progress + labels.** Per-notebook
  `[i/N] rendering …` lines while heavy cached notebooks execute, and its
  warnings are no longer mislabeled `stale:` outside `--check`. A crashing
  blog post now lands in the report like TOC entries instead of aborting the
  whole build.
- **Per-notebook progress lines** during `build` and `serve` rebuilds
  (`[2/7] rendering content/ch2.py...`), so long notebook builds no longer
  look hung.
- **Theme polish.** Palettes now follow the OS `prefers-color-scheme` on
  first visit (the manual toggle still overrides); instant-navigation
  prefetch, a page-load progress bar, and a back-to-top button are enabled.

### Fixed

- **Declared `tomlkit` and `markdown` as direct dependencies** — both are
  imported directly but were only present transitively via marimo/mkdocs, so
  an upstream dependency shuffle could have crashed every build at import
  time. Dropped unused `jinja2` and `pybtex`.

## [0.1.26] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Cached renders no longer invalidate on every release.** The committed
  `_rendered/` body signature embedded the full marimo-book package version, so
  *any* release — even one that can't change a notebook's output (CLI, nav CSS,
  `sync-releases`) — marked every cached page stale. A plain `marimo-book build`
  then fell back to *executing* the notebooks; on a deploy runner without the
  notebooks' real dependencies that published tracebacks instead of the docs.
  The signature now keys on a hand-bumped `_RENDER_OUTPUT_VERSION` contract,
  bumped only when the export output itself changes. Upgrading marimo-book no
  longer forces a re-render (and re-execution of heavy notebooks) unless the
  render output actually changed.

## [0.1.25] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **`sync-releases` changelog heading levels.** Each release renders under a
  `## <version>` heading, but a release note's own headings (e.g. an
  `## Installation` section) were embedded verbatim and collided with the page
  structure. The body's headings are now demoted by two levels (H1→H3, H2→H4,
  …, capped at H6) so they nest under the version heading. Previously only `#`
  (H1) was demoted.

## [0.1.24] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Release-download button.** A client-hydrated component for books that
  document a downloadable app: drop `release_download("owner/repo")` (Python)
  or `<div data-mb-release-download data-repo="owner/repo">` (raw HTML) on a
  page and the browser fetches the repo's latest GitHub release, matches assets
  to platforms, and renders OS-aware download cards with a "Recommended for
  you" highlight. The build stays hermetic (no network); responses are cached
  in `sessionStorage` with `ETag` revalidation to respect the GitHub API rate
  limit; any error (offline, rate-limited, private repo) falls back to a plain
  releases link, and a `<noscript>` link keeps it working without JS. Cards are
  built with DOM APIs (no `innerHTML`) and hrefs are scheme-guarded. See the
  [GitHub Releases](https://marimobook.org/release-download-guide/) guide.
- **Changelog from GitHub Releases.** `marimo-book sync-releases` fetches a
  repo's releases (config: a `release_notes:` block in `book.yml`) and writes a
  Markdown changelog page — one section per release with date, link, and body.
  A *generate-then-build* step (like `sync-deps`), so `build` stays hermetic;
  run it in CI on a `repository_dispatch` from the app repo's release workflow.
  `--check` is a CI staleness gate; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is honored for private repos
  / rate limits. Uses only the standard library (no new dependency).

## [0.1.23] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Nested API package nav alignment (for real this time).** 0.1.22's fix was
  ineffective — its selector had lower specificity than the leaf-indent rule,
  so a collapsible package label (e.g. `feat.utils`) still rendered indented
  *further* than its own children. The override now outspecifies the leaf rule.
- **Links no longer disappear when clicked.** Footer and content links lacked
  explicit `focus`/`active`/`visited` colors, so a clicked link could render
  with a near-invisible color. All interactive states are now pinned visible.

### Changed

- Drop Material's "Made with Material for MkDocs" footer notice
  (`extra.generator: false`); the "Made with Marimo-Book" credit remains.

## [0.1.22] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- Footer now always credits marimo-book — a "Made with
  [Marimo-Book](https://marimobook.org)" link is appended to the footer
  copyright (alongside any `copyright:` set in `book.yml`), beside Material's
  own "Made with Material for MkDocs" notice.

### Fixed

- Nested nav packages (e.g. an API-reference package like `feat.utils` with
  submodules) no longer over-indent. Their collapsible link wraps an `<a>` in a
  padded `.md-nav__container`, and the leaf-indent rule applied to *both* —
  double-padding the parent label further right than its own children. The
  inner link's padding is now zeroed so it lines up with its sibling entries.
- Plotly **animations now play** in the rendered site. The hydration shim
  called `Plotly.newPlot(mount, data, layout)` but never registered the
  figure's `frames`, so animations rendered only frame 0 and the play/pause
  and slider controls did nothing. Frames are now applied via
  `Plotly.addFrames` after the initial plot.
- Layout no longer hugs the window edge. The content grid (`max-width: 68rem`)
  only centers above ~1360px, so between the sidebar-dock breakpoint (~1220px)
  and 1360px the sidebar and table-of-contents sat flush against the viewport.
  A `padding-inline` gutter on `.md-grid` keeps a margin at every width.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`mode: cached` — committed, no-execute notebook outputs.** A new per-page
  (and book-default) render mode for heavy notebooks that shouldn't re-execute on
  every docs deploy (GPU models, long-running pipelines). The author runs
  `marimo-book render` once — which executes the `mode: cached` notebooks with
  their real dependencies and commits the rendered bodies under `_rendered/`
  (a version-controlled artifact, keyed by source hash **plus** the
  render-affecting config — `defaults`, `dependencies`, `widget_defaults` — and
  the marimo-book version) — and a plain CI runner can then `marimo-book build`
  without executing anything. This is the marimo-book analogue of jupyter-book's
  `execute: off`. Only the notebook *body* is committed (not buttons/link-rewrites),
  so changing `launch_buttons`, the repo URL, or the TOC never invalidates the
  artifact. `marimo-book render --check` exits nonzero when any committed output
  is stale, for a CI freshness gate. During `build`, a stale/missing artifact
  warns and falls back to a live render so local authoring still works — but
  under `--strict` it is a hard error with no execution, so a CI build never
  silently re-runs a notebook the author forgot to render.

### Fixed

- `api_docs` no longer follows Griffe import-alias members when walking a
  package's submodules. A submodule doing `import <root_pkg>` (e.g. py-feat's
  `feat.utils.io` doing `import feat`) surfaced as a resolvable alias that the
  walk recursed into forever, crashing the build with `OSError: File name too
  long`. Such aliases are now skipped; package-owned submodules are unaffected.

## [0.1.20] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Sidebar logo (`logo_placement: sidebar`) is now left-aligned with the nav
  instead of centered — a centered logo read as shoved to the right next to
  the left-aligned header title and chapter list.
- Dotted `api_docs` package names (`packages: ['a.b']`) map to path segments
  (`api/a/b/…`, not a literal-dotted `api/a.b/` dir) and use the full dotted
  name as the nav label, so packages sharing a last segment (e.g.
  `org_a.utils` + `org_b.utils`) no longer collide on the nav key.
- Staged API reference pages are now counted in the build summary
  (`BuildReport.pages`), consistent with blog and changelog pages.

## [0.1.19] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- `api_docs` feature flag: auto-generate a Python "API Reference" section
  from a companion package's docstrings via mkdocstrings + Griffe. Names
  packages by import name and/or source `paths`; stages one page per public
  module and a nested nav section. Opt in with `api_docs.enabled: true` and
  install `marimo-book[api]`.
- **Blog / news module (`blog: {enabled: true}`).** Opt-in blog built on
  Material's `blog` + `tags` plugins. Posts — Markdown `.md` or marimo `.py`
  notebooks — drop by convention into `blog/posts/` (no TOC entry per post)
  and render through the normal pipeline. Metadata via YAML front-matter or a
  `# /// blog` block; `date` defaults from a `YYYY-MM-DD-…` filename, `title`
  from the first heading. Bylines come from a merged roster of `book.yml`
  authors plus an optional `.authors.yml`. A teaser is auto-inserted. RSS via
  the new `marimo-book[blog]` extra. Scaffold a post with
  `marimo-book new-post "Title"` (`--notebook` for `.py`). Off by default;
  requires `mkdocs-material>=9.7.0`.

## [0.1.18] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **`__file__`-relative paths now resolve to the repo root on WASM
  pages.** The PEP 723 (and precompute) staging step copied each
  notebook into a temp *sub-directory* next to the source before
  handing it to `MarimoIslandGenerator.from_file()`. Since marimo
  0.23.6 sets a notebook's `__file__` to that staged path, the extra
  directory level made the common `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`
  root-detection idiom land one level too deep (e.g. resolving to
  `content/` instead of the book root), so file-relative asset paths
  like `IMG_DIR = _ROOT / "images"` missed their target. Staging now
  writes a sibling *file* in the source's own directory (via the new
  `staged_sibling_file()` helper), preserving directory depth. The
  orphan-cleanup sweep handles both the new leaked files and legacy
  leaked sub-tempdirs.

### Changed

- **Require marimo ≥ 0.23.6.** That release ships
  [marimo-team/marimo#9409](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/9409),
  which makes `MarimoIslandGenerator.from_file()` propagate the
  notebook filename. On WASM pages, `__file__` and
  `mo.notebook_dir()` now resolve to the notebook's own location
  instead of the host's `__main__`, so relative paths like
  `Path(__file__).parent / "data"` work without a cwd-walk
  workaround. The corresponding caveat has been removed from the
  WASM-mode docs.

### Documentation

- **Document remote data loading on WASM pages.** The WASM-mode section
  of `building.md` now notes that DuckDB can read CSV / Parquet / JSON /
  GeoJSON over HTTP (marimo 0.23.7) and Polars network I/O works in the
  browser (marimo 0.23.5), so an interactive chapter can fetch its own
  data with no backend.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Spinning-plot sliders on WASM pages now drive their widgets.**
  Two related gaps shipped in 0.1.13–0.1.16:
  1. The AST extractor only recognised `WidgetClass(trait=slider.value)`
     and `WidgetClass(trait=float(slider.value))` directly. It missed
     the heavily-used dartbrains MR_Physics pattern of pre-extracting
     slider values into intermediate locals first:
       ```python
       _b0 = b0_larmor_slider.value
       _widget = PrecessionWidget(b0=_b0, flip_angle=30.0, ...)
       ```
     Every PrecessionWidget instance constructed this way silently
     fell off the registry — six of nine MR_Physics widget mounts on
     production had no `data-driven-by` entry at all.
  2. Widgets with no detectable slider drivers (literal-only kwargs)
     were dropped from the source-order list before zipping with DOM
     mounts. That misaligned every subsequent driver map onto the
     wrong widget's mount — e.g. a TransformCubeWidget construction
     paired with a NetMagnetizationWidget mount, so the cube's
     translation sliders silently moved a different widget's
     n_protons trait. Rare to spot because the symptoms looked like
     "nothing happened", but it was the underlying cause of several
     subtle MR_Physics misbehaviours.

  Fix part 1: per-cell alias map captures `_local = slider.value`
  assignments, then `_extract_value_var_ref` recursively follows the
  alias when it sees `Widget(trait=_local)` or `Widget(trait=float(_local))`.

  Fix part 2: undriven widgets stay in `widget_drivers_in_order` as
  empty `{}` placeholders so the zip pairs each AST construction with
  its corresponding DOM mount in document order. The empty entries
  are skipped at emit time (no `data-driven-by` written), preserving
  the previous semantics for widgets that don't need a driver map.

  New regression tests:
    test_wasm_anywidget_resolves_intermediate_local_alias_to_slider
    test_wasm_anywidget_zip_alignment_preserved_with_undriven_widgets

## [0.1.16] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Sliders sharing a label across cells now resolve to distinct widgets.**
  v0.1.15 matched widget kwargs to rendered sliders by `data-label`
  alone, with a first-wins `setdefault`. The dartbrains motivating case
  hit this on Preprocessing.py: the TransformCubeWidget and the
  CostFunctionWidget both label their first translation slider
  "Translate X", but the cube's covers `-15..15` step `0.5` while the
  cost function's covers `0..20` step `1`. With label-only matching, the
  CostFunctionWidget's `trans_x` resolved to the cube's slider object-id,
  so dragging the cost function's "Translate X" silently moved the
  cube's matrix readout instead of its own.

  Fix: match on the discriminating tuple
  ``(control_tag, label, start, stop, step)`` extracted from the AST
  call site (`mo.ui.slider(start=…, stop=…, step=…, label=…)`) and the
  rendered control's `data-start`/`data-stop`/`data-step`/`data-label`
  attrs. Two sliders sharing a label but with different numeric ranges
  now get distinct signatures and resolve correctly. Falls back to
  label-only when the AST signature can't be reconstructed (e.g. slider
  built with non-literal kwargs), preserving the previous best-effort
  behaviour for that path.

## [0.1.15] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **WASM-mode driver map now survives full island-content rebuild.**
  v0.1.14 emitted `data-driven-by` on both the mount div and the
  surrounding `<marimo-ui-element>`, expecting only the inner div to
  be rewrapped by the runtime. Live verification on /Preprocessing/
  showed something more aggressive: marimo's runtime *replaces every
  descendant of `<marimo-island>`* on its first kernel-driven render,
  not just the inner anywidget. The fresh `<marimo-ui-element>` keeps
  the same `object-id` (so the runtime's UIElementRegistry stays
  consistent) but `data-driven-by` is wiped along with everything else.
  Symptoms: `parentDrivenBy: null` on every mount, model_ids in the
  live DOM differing from the served HTML.

  Fix: emit a page-global `<script type="application/json"
  class="marimo-book-anywidget-drivers">{…}</script>` blob, keyed by
  the widget's parent `<marimo-ui-element>.object-id`. The JS shim's
  new `loadDriverRegistry()` parses it once at boot, and `readDrivenBy()`
  now has three fallback layers: mount-div attribute → parent
  ui-element attribute → global registry by object-id. The mount and
  parent paths still cover static + precompute (where the registry
  isn't strictly needed); the global registry is the only resort in
  WASM mode after the kernel rebuilds the island.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **WASM-mode `data-driven-by` now survives the runtime div rewrap.**
  v0.1.13 emitted `data-driven-by` only on `<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">`,
  but in WASM mode marimo's runtime eventually re-emits a fresh
  `<marimo-anywidget>` once the kernel finishes initialising. The
  `installAnywidgetRuntimeIntercept` MutationObserver replaces it with a
  brand-new mount div, copying only marimo-known attributes
  (`data-js-url`, `data-initial-value`, `data-js-hash`, `data-model-id`)
  — so our custom `data-driven-by` attribute was silently dropped.
  Net effect on the dartbrains motivating case: the JS shim's
  `applyDrivers()` ran but found no map, slider drags silently fell back
  to defaults again. Live verification on /Preprocessing/ confirmed
  the issue (mount divs had `data-mb-hydrated="1"` from the rewrap path
  but no `data-driven-by`, and the model_ids in the live DOM didn't match
  the model_ids in the served HTML).

  Fix: `_inject_widget_drivers` now emits `data-driven-by` on **both**
  the mount div *and* the surrounding `<marimo-ui-element>`. The
  `<marimo-ui-element>` is never replaced by the runtime — only its
  `random-id` mutates — so the parent copy survives every rewrap. The
  shim's new `readDrivenBy(el)` helper checks the mount first (covers
  static + precompute paths where `_handle_ui_wrapper` may have
  unwrapped the parent) and falls back to `el.closest("marimo-ui-element")`
  (covers the WASM rewrap path).

## [0.1.13] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **WASM-mode anywidget sliders now drive widgets live.** Marimo's runtime
  bumps a `random-id` attribute on each `<marimo-ui-element>` after the
  kernel finishes re-executing a cell, then calls
  `firstElementChild.rerender()` to refresh the cell output. Our static
  shim mount (`<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">`) had neither
  `rerender()` nor the `__type__ === "__custom_marimo_element__"` marker
  the runtime checks, so every slider drag fired
  `[marimo-ui-element] first child must have a rerender method` and the
  widget DOM stayed frozen on its build-time defaults — Pyodide ran,
  cells re-executed, but the visible state never advanced. Two coordinated
  changes:
  1. `rewrite_anywidget_html` accepts a new `notebook_source` kwarg
     (passed by `render_wasm_page`). When set, an AST pass walks every
     `@app.cell` function for `var = mo.ui.<control>(label="…")`
     definitions and `WidgetClass(trait=var.value)` (and
     `float(var.value)` / `int(...)` / `bool(...)`) constructions, then
     cross-references with the rendered HTML's `<marimo-ui-element>` /
     `data-label` to emit
     `data-driven-by='{"trait": "object-id", …}'` JSON on each anywidget
     mount. Mounts and constructions pair up by document order.
  2. `marimo_book.js`'s `hydrateMount` now sets
     `el.__type__ = "__custom_marimo_element__"` and an `el.rerender()`
     that reads the `data-driven-by` map and pulls live values via
     `window._marimo_private_UIElementRegistry.lookupValue(objectId)`,
     applying each as `model.set(trait, value)`. The widget's existing
     `change:<trait>` listeners + animation loop pick up the new state
     on the next frame — no DOM swap, no kernel round-trip on the JS
     side, no anywidget Comm bridge. The same `applyDrivers()` runs at
     hydrate time so the first paint reflects the user's current
     control state instead of build-time defaults.

  Net effect on the dartbrains motivating case: dragging Translate-X on
  the `TransformCubeWidget` in `/Preprocessing/` now updates the cube's
  affine matrix readout in real time. Same for `CostFunctionWidget`,
  `SmoothingWidget`, and the `MR_Physics` widgets that take
  `mo.ui.slider` kwargs. Widgets without slider drivers (literal kwargs
  only) still get no `data-driven-by` — preserves the existing
  static + precompute behaviour exactly.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Anywidgets now render in WASM-mode pages.** Build-time
  `rewrite_anywidget_html` rewrites every `<marimo-anywidget>` in
  `MarimoIslandGenerator`'s initial render to our shim mount form
  (`<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">`), so static + precompute
  pages have always worked. WASM-mode pages were broken: once Pyodide
  boots and the islands runtime re-executes anywidget cells, marimo's
  React renderer emits FRESH `<marimo-anywidget>` elements with
  `data-js-url="data:text/javascript;base64,..."` and the runtime's
  `isTrustedVirtualFileUrl` check rejects every data URL emitted
  before the kernel's `initialized` message wins the race against the
  first batch of widget cells, throwing
  `Refusing to load anywidget module from untrusted URL` and leaving
  the cell output area empty (the dartbrains MR_Physics page was the
  motivating case). New `installAnywidgetRuntimeIntercept()` in the
  shim attaches a `MutationObserver` on `document.body` that watches
  for runtime-emitted `<marimo-anywidget>` insertions, copies their
  data-* attributes onto a fresh `<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">`,
  replaces the original, and calls the same `hydrateMount` static
  pages use — which loads the data URL via the host page's `import()`
  (no trust check on the host) and wires up a local model. marimo's
  React render fires first and logs the trust warning into a
  now-doomed React tree, the observer then removes the element and
  React's `disconnectedCallback` unmounts cleanly. `data-mb-rewrapped`
  makes the rewrap idempotent. State sync trade-off matches the
  existing static-mode shim: anywidget state set in the browser
  doesn't round-trip to Pyodide, but cells that take `mo.ui.*`
  controls as kwargs re-emit a new `<marimo-anywidget>` with updated
  `data-initial-value` on each kernel re-execution, which the
  observer re-hydrates with the new state. `<marimo-plotly>`
  deliberately not intercepted — the islands runtime loads Plotly.js
  from CDN and skips the trust check entirely.
- **Precompute slider value swaps now also re-hydrate anywidgets.**
  `applyValue` in the precompute shim now calls `hydrateAll(el)`
  alongside the existing `hydratePlotly(el)` after each
  `el.innerHTML = baseSnapshot[idx]` swap, so reactive cells whose
  build-time snapshot includes an un-hydrated
  `<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">` placeholder get hydrated when
  the slider moves to a value that swaps in different widget HTML.
  Idempotent via `[data-mb-hydrated]`.

## [0.1.11] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Precompute pages now mount the slider on first arrival via Material's
  `navigation.instant`** — no more "hard refresh to see the slider" UX.
  The `<script type="application/json">` blocks the JS shim was reading
  triggered Material's instant-nav script-handler with
  `SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'replaceWith' on 'Element': Unexpected
  token ':'` on JSON's first colon, silently dropping the script element
  from the swapped DOM and leaving the shim with no data. Switched all
  four emitter sites (widget metadata + lookup table for both independent
  and joint-group widgets) to
  `<div class="marimo-book-precompute-data" markdown="0"><template>{json}</template></div>`.
  `<template>` isn't a script so Material's handler ignores it; the
  `<div markdown="0">` wrapper opts out of the `md_in_html` Markdown
  extension's recursive processing — without it, CommonMark's
  backslash-escape rule rewrites `\\D` → `\D` mid-pipeline on JS regex
  literals embedded in cell HTML, producing invalid JSON. New
  `_safe_json_for_template` helper escapes literal `<` `>` `&` to JSON
  unicode escapes (`<` etc.) so the payload contains no markup the
  HTML parser would misinterpret. The JS reader (`readPrecomputeJson`)
  accepts both `<template>` (current emitter) and `<script>` (legacy)
  for stale-cache rollover safety.
- **Plotly figures inside precompute reactive cells no longer disappear
  when the slider moves.** `applyValue` rewrites a cell's HTML via
  `el.innerHTML = baseSnapshot[idx]`, swapping in a build-time static
  snapshot that contains an un-hydrated `<div class="marimo-book-plotly"
  data-figure="...">` placeholder; previously hydrated plots were
  obliterated. Now `hydratePlotly(el)` runs after each swap (both
  independent-widget and joint-group `applyValue` paths). Idempotent
  via `[data-mb-plotly]` so already-hydrated mounts aren't re-rendered.
- **Spurious console.error spam during instant-nav arrivals downgraded
  to console.debug.** `bootAll` fires twice on instant-nav
  (`DOMContentLoaded`/immediate-eval + `document$.subscribe`); the first
  call sometimes catches a transient DOM where the precompute template
  is in the tree but its text content hasn't been integrated yet, and
  `JSON.parse` rejects on a truncated payload. The second call recovers
  in milliseconds. The error log was misleading users into believing
  the slider was broken when it was about to mount.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Precompute slider control panel now mounts above the cell that
  actually consumes the widget**, not above the first cell whose
  output happens to differ across re-exports. The previous "first
  reactive cell by diff" heuristic was fragile: any non-deterministic
  upstream output (sklearn `random_state`, plotly trace IDs, repr
  addresses, transient prints, library deprecation warnings, …) made
  upstream cells appear reactive and the slider mounted there,
  leaving the actual viewer far below it on the page. The new anchor
  is AST-derived: the source-order-earliest `@app.cell` whose
  function parameter list contains a widget variable name. Marimo's
  parameter list IS the data-flow graph, so this is a strict
  improvement on the diff heuristic. Falls back to the legacy
  first-reactive-cell behaviour when no consumer is found in the AST
  (defensive — should never happen on a valid notebook). The
  motivating case was dartbrains' ICA chapter: the brain viewer cell
  is the only cell taking `component_slider` as a parameter, so the
  slider now mounts immediately above it. New
  `find_widget_consumer_cell_idx(source, widget_var_names)` helper
  in `transforms.precompute`; new `splice_anchor_cell_idx` field on
  `PrecomputeResult`.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-04-28

### Added

- **WASM-mode pages now auto-install third-party deps via in-browser
  `micropip`.** Marimo's islands JS bundle auto-loads
  Pyodide-bundled scientific packages (numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn,
  matplotlib, nilearn, nibabel, …) by import-scanning each cell, but
  pure-Python PyPI-only deps (the dartbrains-flavoured `nltools` /
  `dartbrains-tools` case) silently failed because the islands runtime
  has no PEP 723 / micropip codepath. The preprocessor now stages a
  sibling-tempdir copy of each WASM notebook with two transforms
  injected: (1) a freshly-generated `# /// script` PEP 723 block at
  the top of the file, derived from a fresh AST walk of the notebook's
  imports + marimo's own ~777-entry import → PyPI distribution
  mapping table, and (2) a new `@app.cell async def _():` after the
  `app = marimo.App(...)` line (and after any `with app.setup:`
  block) whose body does `await micropip.install([...])` and returns
  a sentinel `_marimo_book_micropip_done = True`. That sentinel is
  appended as a parameter to every existing `@app.cell` function so
  marimo's dataflow scheduler runs the install before any other
  cell — without rewriting any user cell body. Pyodide's micropip
  filters by `sys.modules`, so passing the full dep list across all
  pages is safe (bundled packages no-op). The install is wrapped in
  `try/except ImportError` so build-time CPython execution (where
  `micropip` doesn't exist) doesn't crash. Notebooks with `with
  app.setup:` blocks are supported but emit an informational note —
  setup-block imports run at module-import time before any cell, and
  `await` is invalid at module level, so any non-Pyodide-bundled
  imports in the setup block must be moved to a regular `@app.cell`.
- **Auto-generated PEP 723 blocks for marimo notebooks.** WASM pages
  get the block unconditionally (paired with the micropip bootstrap
  above); static and sandbox pages opt in with
  `dependencies.auto_pep723: true` — useful for `molab` / sandbox
  reproducibility. The build never modifies your source `.py` files;
  blocks live only in the staged tempdir copy marimo reads at build
  time. New `marimo-book sync-deps [--check]` CLI commits generated
  blocks back into source notebooks when you want them under version
  control. New `dependencies.{auto_pep723, pin, extras, overrides,
  requires_python}` fields in `book.yml`.

### Changed

- **WASM pages no longer show a static "Initializing…" spinner above
  the rendered cells.** The `MarimoIslandGenerator` init island's
  hide-trigger is unreliable and the spinner was lingering over
  already-working reactive cells. Cells' static-export initial output
  covers the hydration window, so dropping the spinner is a clean UX
  win.
- **Sidebar logo (`logo_placement: sidebar`) is now horizontally
  centered in the sidebar column** instead of left-flush. The previous
  asymmetric padding tried to align the logo with chapter section
  labels, but the labels' own indentation meant they never quite
  matched anyway. Centering reads more naturally as a banner above
  the nav.

### Fixed

- **Per-notebook `*Written by …*` attribution lines are no longer
  stripped from rendered pages.** The export transform was filtering
  any line matching that pattern from every markdown cell, on the
  assumption that book-level `authors:` would surface per-page
  bylines through the page header — but that rendering path was never
  wired up, so attributions were silently lost. The line now passes
  through and renders as the italic byline under the chapter title,
  matching the original Jupyter Book convention.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **GitHub / molab / download launch-button URLs 404'd when the book
  lived in a subdirectory of its repo.** The URL builders prepended
  the source path *relative to the book root* to `<repo>/blob/<branch>/`,
  so a book at `docs/book.yml` pointed to
  `<repo>/blob/<branch>/content/<file>` instead of the correct
  `<repo>/blob/<branch>/docs/content/<file>`. The preprocessor now
  walks up from the book directory to the enclosing `.git` and
  prepends that relative path. Books at the repo root (the typical
  case) are unaffected.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Stale assets after every release.** GitHub Pages serves
  `extra_javascript`/`extra_css` with `Cache-Control: max-age=600`,
  so without versioning, every reader saw the previous release's JS
  for ~10 minutes after a deploy — visible as broken precompute
  sliders and unrendered math until a hard-refresh. Local asset URLs
  now get a `?v=<marimo-book-version>` query string appended, so
  every release auto-invalidates the browser cache. CDN URLs are
  pass-through (they version themselves via the `@version` segment).

### Documentation

- **Anywidget reference + drawdata demo merged into one chapter**
  (`docs/content/widgets.py`). The reference and the live demo sat
  three TOC entries apart in 0.1.5; readers landing on the demo had
  to flip back to find the explanation. Now a single `.py` notebook
  covers the architecture, troubleshooting, and the drawdata canvas
  side-by-side.
- **Roadmap chapter trimmed.** The "Shipped in v0.1" + "Shipped
  since v0.1" sections were a mirror of the changelog. Dropped them
  and pointed at the changelog for granular history; the roadmap
  now focuses on what's coming next.
- **README rewrite** to reflect the 0.1.6 surface: WASM mode, static
  reactivity, build cache, autorefs-as-base-dep, the actually-used
  optional extras. Several stale "Not in v0.1" bullets that had
  since shipped were dropped.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Math still didn't render after instant-nav** despite the v0.1.5
  typeset-on-DOMContentLoaded fix. Real cause: `mathjax.js` was
  unconditionally assigning `window.MathJax = {tex, options}`, which
  Material's instant-nav re-executes on every page swap — overwriting
  the already-initialized MathJax library state (typesetPromise,
  startup, etc.) with a stub config object. The very first page
  rendered because the library completed its typeset before the
  clobber; every navigation after that left arithmatex spans as raw
  `\(...\)` text because typesetPromise was gone. Wrap the assignment
  in `if (!window.MathJax)` so the config is set once and the live
  library is never overwritten.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **`mkdocs-autorefs` is now a base dependency.** It used to live
  behind `pip install 'marimo-book[autorefs]'`, which was a recurring
  trip-up — books with `cross_references: true` in `book.yml` would
  build fine on CI (where the extra was installed) and then silently
  drop the cross-ref behavior locally. The package is small and pure
  Python, so promoting it costs nothing. The `[autorefs]` extra is
  kept as an empty alias so existing install scripts keep working.
- **Docs TOC: `widgets.md` (the Anywidgets reference) now sits
  immediately before the `anywidget_demo` page** under Authoring, so
  reference docs and the live demo are next to each other.

### Fixed

- **Precompute slider mounted inline with the wrong cell when an
  upstream cell emitted non-deterministic stderr.** The downstream-
  detection diff in `precompute_page` compared cell bodies byte-for-
  byte, which falsely flagged data-load and `mo.persistent_cache`
  cells as downstream of a precomputed widget when their captured
  warning text varied across re-exports (runner-specific paths,
  cache-state-dependent text, Python's per-process warning dedup).
  The slider mount then anchored to the first such false-positive
  and rendered far from the actual reactive output. The diff now
  strips `<pre class="…marimo-stream-stderr…">…</pre>` blocks before
  comparing, so only genuine display-output differences flag a cell
  as downstream. Stored cell bodies still keep their stderr — only
  the comparison key is normalized. Surfaced by the dartbrains ICA
  chapter.
- **Anywidgets rendered empty on WASM-mode pages.** marimo's
  `MarimoIslandGenerator` runs under `ScriptRuntimeContext` which
  hardcodes `virtual_files_supported=False`, so every anywidget's
  ES module is emitted as a `data:text/javascript;base64,...` URL.
  marimo's islands runtime then refuses to load these
  ("Refusing to load anywidget module from untrusted URL") because
  its trust check only accepts `@file/...` URLs. Result: every
  anywidget on a WASM page disappeared from the DOM — completely
  broken for books like dartbrains' MR_Physics chapter that ship
  custom physics-simulation widgets. The WASM render path now
  post-processes the islands body with the same anywidget rewrite
  as static mode (with `keep_marimo_controls=True` so live
  `<marimo-slider>` / `<marimo-dropdown>` / etc. continue to work
  via marimo's runtime). Anywidget modules now hydrate via
  `marimo_book.js`, which trusts data URLs by design. Caveat: the
  shim doesn't round-trip widget state back to Pyodide — cells
  reading `widget.value` from an anywidget see the *initial* value;
  marimo's own `mo.ui.*` controls still round-trip normally.
- **Math rendering racing instant-nav.** Material's `document$` is an
  RxJS `Subject` (not BehaviorSubject) — every page swap (instant-nav
  click) emits *before* `mathjax.js` subscribes, so MathJax silently
  never typesets and arithmatex spans render as raw `\(...\)` /
  `\[...\]` LaTeX text. Same bug class as the v0.1.1 precompute slider
  boot race, fixed the same way: belt-and-suspenders typeset on
  DOMContentLoaded *and* every `document$` emission, both idempotent.

### Documentation

- `book_yml.md` reference now covers the full schema: `analytics`
  (provider + property), the complete `precompute` block (all five
  caps + `exclude_pages`), `url` (canonical site URL), `bibliography`
  + `cite_style`. Several fields were missing or sketched in
  one-liners.
- Drop the "requires `pip install 'marimo-book[autorefs]'`"
  reminders now that the plugin ships in the base install.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`defaults.suppress_warnings`** flag in `book.yml`. When `true`, the
  preprocessor runs `marimo export` with `PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore` so
  third-party library warnings (numpy, pandas, deprecation notices,
  etc.) don't surface as visible stderr blocks in cell output. Off by
  default so existing books don't lose visible warnings unexpectedly.
  Useful for tutorial books that import scientific libraries whose
  routine warnings distract from the lesson.
- **Tuning-caps section** in `Building → Static reactivity` docs.
  Documents how to interpret the build report's `widgets_skipped`
  warning and which `precompute.max_*` cap to bump for common
  patterns (heavy imports, large per-render HTML, joint groups).

### Fixed

- **DataFrame tables rendered with browser-default styling.** The
  prose-table CSS rule was scoped to `table:not([class])`, which
  silently missed pandas tables (they ship with `class="dataframe"`)
  and any marimo cell-output table. Tables under
  `.marimo-book-output` and `table.dataframe` now get the same
  hairline border + zebra striping + padding treatment as prose
  tables, plus a subtle treatment for the empty index-column header
  pandas emits.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Static reactivity demo: cell content rendered as raw markdown when
  the slider was moved off its default value.** The precompute lookup
  table embedded in each page stored marimo's markdown export of each
  cell, but the JS shim sets `el.innerHTML = delta[idx]` directly —
  pasting raw markdown into the DOM. The default-value cells looked
  correct because they live in the page body and pass through mkdocs;
  every other value's cells came out as ` ```python … ``` ` and
  `| Scale | Value | |---|---| …`. The preprocessor now pre-renders
  each delta to HTML at build time using the same Python-Markdown
  extension list mkdocs is configured with, so the lookup-table values
  match what mkdocs emits for the body. Latent since precompute first
  shipped; only obvious after 0.1.2's inline-controls placement
  (#19) put the slider next to the cells it drives.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-27

Patch release: Jupyter-Book-style sidebar logo, header launch buttons
with icons, automatic `index.md` promotion so the home page just works,
Plotly figure hydration, and a handful of related rendering fixes.

### Added

- **`logo_placement: sidebar`** in `book.yml` — renders the logo as a
  prominent banner above the left nav (Jupyter-Book chrome) instead of
  the small Material header icon. Default stays `header`. CSS lives in
  a separate stylesheet that's only emitted when the flag is set.
- **Header launch buttons** (default). The molab / GitHub / Download
  row now mounts in Material's top header bar as icon-only buttons via
  a small JS shim, with a screen-reader-only label. The legacy
  `placement: page` mode is still available for the over-the-title row.
- **Plotly hydration**. Marimo emits each plotly figure as a custom
  `<marimo-plotly>` element with the figure spec inlined as JSON. The
  preprocessor now rewraps as `<div class="marimo-book-plotly">` and
  `marimo_book.js` lazy-loads Plotly.js from jsdelivr on first encounter
  to render fully interactive charts (zoom / pan / hover).
- **Auto-promote first TOC entry to `index.md`**. Without this, mkdocs
  serves nothing at the site root; the header logo's `/` link 404'd.
  Authors don't need to know about the convention — whatever entry is
  first in the TOC becomes the home page transparently.
- **Empty-section tolerance**. Sections with `children: null` (or no
  children) no longer trip pydantic; they're silently dropped from the
  nav so authors can stub out placeholders mid-draft.

### Fixed

- **Sidebar logo overlap** with the chapter list when scrolled. The
  Material default sticky title had no background; chapters scrolled
  *behind* the logo. Now opaque + capped at 96 px with `z-index: 1`.
- **Dark-mode primary turning violet** despite a green `book.yml`
  palette. `_inject_palette` now writes the user's primary/accent into
  *both* schemes with `!important`; extra.css's defaults drop the
  `!important` so the user palette wins.
- **Header / sidebar logo alignment**: 1.1 rem left padding so the
  sidebar logo sits at the same x as the header's site title (within
  ~2 px).
- **Escaped `<marimo-*>` element leaks**. `marimo export ipynb`
  sometimes emits anywidget / plotly / slider tags HTML-escaped under a
  text/markdown mime; the preprocessor now detects the broader prefix
  list and routes through the rewriter so the raw escaped tag never
  leaks as visible text.
- **Inline precompute controls**. The widget control mount used to
  splice at the top of the page body, often far from the cells it
  drove (e.g. ICA's brain-plot slider was hundreds of px above the
  brain plot). Now lands immediately above the first reactive cell.
- **Orphan precompute temp dirs**. The precompute pipeline's
  `TemporaryDirectory(dir=py_path.parent)` leaks `marimo_book_precompute_*`
  directories when the marimo subprocess is interrupted (Ctrl-C,
  watcher restart, OOM). Added `cleanup_orphan_precompute_dirs` that
  sweeps these at the start of every build.
- **Drawdata anywidget demo on the docs site** rendered as a
  `ModuleNotFoundError` because CI didn't have `drawdata` installed.
  Added the install step to the docs workflow.

### Changed

- **Material's GitHub source widget** (the version + stars + forks
  card next to `repo_url`) is hidden via CSS — redundant with the new
  GitHub icon button. `repo_url` is still set in `mkdocs.yml` so
  per-page "Edit on GitHub" links work.
- Removed Material's separate Print button (Cmd-P is universal).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-26

Patch release: two render-path bug fixes plus a working drawdata
anywidget demo on the docs site, and a top-level `CNAME` convention
so the docs site can ship under a custom domain.

### Fixed

- **Anywidget render under `text/markdown` mime.** `marimo export
  ipynb` sometimes downgrades an anywidget HTML bundle to a
  `text/markdown` blob with the `<marimo-anywidget>` tag fully
  HTML-escaped (`&lt;marimo-anywidget`). The mime-bundle picker now
  detects that, unescapes, and routes through the existing rewriter
  so the static mount `<div>` is emitted. Without this, anywidgets
  authored via third-party libraries like
  [drawdata](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata) would render as
  visible escaped HTML text instead of the live widget.
- **Precompute slider boot race.** Material's `document$` is an
  RxJS `Subject` (not a `BehaviorSubject`) — subscribers added after
  its initial emission miss it. Combined with the `defer`'d shim
  script tag, direct page loads occasionally raced past the initial
  `document$` event, leaving the precompute control mount empty (and
  hidden by `:empty { display: none }` CSS, so invisible to authors).
  Boot is now belt-and-suspenders: run once via `DOMContentLoaded` /
  immediate, *and* subscribe to `document$` for instant-nav swaps.
  All boot work is idempotent.

### Added

- **Top-level `CNAME` convention.** Drop a `CNAME` file at the book
  root next to `book.yml`; the preprocessor copies it into the
  staged docs tree so mkdocs ships it as `_site/CNAME`. GitHub Pages
  preserves the custom-domain setting on every redeploy.
- **drawdata anywidget demo** in the docs site
  (`Authoring → Anywidget demo: drawdata`) — a live click-to-draw
  scatter canvas that proves the static anywidget pipeline renders
  third-party widgets correctly.

### Changed

- `marimobook.org` is the canonical docs URL (was
  `ljchang.github.io/marimo-book/`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26

**First stable release.** marimo-book is suitable for real production
use. The `book.yml` schema is frozen within the 0.1.x series — fields
may be added (additive, backward-compatible) but no field will be
removed or have its meaning changed without a major version bump.

This release ships per-page WASM render mode via marimo's islands
runtime, completing the render-mode story: every page can opt into
its preferred reactivity model (static / static + precompute / WASM)
based on the chapter's needs, with the rest staying fast and light.

### Added — WASM render mode (per-page opt-in)

- **`mode: wasm`** as a per-entry override in `book.yml` TOC entries.
  When set, the page is rendered through marimo's
  `MarimoIslandGenerator` instead of our static `cells_to_markdown`
  pipeline. Marimo's runtime + Pyodide load in the browser at first
  paint; cells become natively reactive, no precompute caps apply,
  continuous sliders work as you'd expect from a real notebook.
- `book.defaults.mode` is now widened to `Literal["static", "wasm"]`
  for whole-book defaults; `wasm` per-entry override coexists.
- `Book` config gains `FileEntry.effective_mode(default)` helper that
  resolves the per-entry override against the book-wide default.
- New module `src/marimo_book/transforms/wasm.py` with
  `render_wasm_page()` — invokes `MarimoIslandGenerator.from_file()`,
  awaits `build()`, returns `render_head() + render_body(style="")`
  ready to splice into the staged page. Per-page head injection (no
  global `extra_javascript` pollution).
- Static reactivity (`precompute.enabled`) is automatically a no-op
  for WASM pages — marimo's runtime handles reactivity natively, so
  there's no point in our build-time precompute pipeline.
- New CSS in `assets/extra.css` overriding marimo island fonts to
  Geist (matches our static theme), suppressing per-island margins,
  hiding marimo's loading spinner. Phase 1 styling — pixel-perfect
  match is a polish pass.
- New live demo chapter `docs/content/wasm_demo.py` configured with
  `mode: wasm` in the docs site TOC. Demonstrates a continuous
  `mo.ui.slider(1, 100)` driving live Python computation in the
  browser — the same widget call would render as static-only on a
  non-WASM page (no precompute candidate without an explicit step).

### Asset hosting

Marimo islands runtime + style are loaded from jsdelivr CDN by default
(matches what `MarimoIslandGenerator.render_head()` emits and what we
already do for Google Fonts + MathJax). Pyodide loads on demand from
its own CDN inside marimo's bundle. Self-hosting is on the roadmap
for the privacy-conscious / offline case but not yet implemented.

## [0.1.0a6] — 2026-04-26

Multi-widget reactivity + dartbrains-driven fixes. Static reactivity
now handles independent and joint (cross-product) multi-widget pages.
Multi-line widget call definitions are recognised. The all-kwargs
slider style (`mo.ui.slider(start=A, stop=B, step=N)`) — marimo's
recommended form — now produces precompute candidates. Validated by
real testing on the dartbrains course site.

### Added — joint multi-widget + multi-line widget calls

- **Joint multi-widget precompute (cross-product).** Widgets that share
  downstream cells now precompute together via the cartesian product of
  their values. Each joint group emits a single
  `<script class="marimo-book-precompute-group">` metadata + lookup
  table block keyed by `JSON.stringify([v1, v2, ...])`. The JS shim
  reads every widget in the group on each input event, constructs the
  combo key, and swaps cells together. Bounded by
  `max_combinations_per_page` — a 9-widget group with 5 values each is
  1.95M combos and trips the cap; 2-widget groups with ~10 values each
  fit comfortably.
- Connected-components grouping (`_group_widgets_by_downstream`):
  union-find pass over the cell→widget map. Independent widgets stay
  in singleton groups (existing behaviour); widgets sharing any
  downstream cell get unioned into one joint group.
- **Multi-line widget call substitution.** Widget calls spanning
  multiple lines (the dartbrains pattern: `mo.ui.slider(\n    start=0,
  \n    stop=10,\n    step=1,\n)`) now substitute correctly. The
  splice replaces the entire `(start_line, col)`–`(end_line, end_col)`
  range with the unparsed call expression — multi-line call collapses
  to one line in the temp source consumed by `marimo export` (never
  shown to the user).

### Added — multi-widget independent precompute (1/2)

- **Multi-widget independent precompute.** Lifts the v0.1.0a5
  single-widget-per-page restriction. Pages with N discrete widgets
  whose downstream cells are **disjoint** now precompute each widget
  independently. Each widget gets its own input control + lookup
  table, and the JS shim limits cell swaps to the widget that drives
  them. Joint widgets (sharing a downstream cell) still cause the
  whole page to render static with a clear "joint multi-widget
  precompute is deferred" warning.
- AST scanner now recognises `mo.ui.slider(start=A, stop=B, step=N)`
  with all-kwargs form (marimo's recommended style and what dartbrains
  uses everywhere). Continues to recognise positional and
  start/stop-positional + step-kwarg forms.
- New `estimate_renders_independent()` helper sums per-widget renders
  (1 + sum(values_i - 1)) instead of the cartesian product. The
  preprocessor uses this against `max_combinations_per_page` so the
  cap reflects realistic v1 cost — independent multi-widget pages no
  longer trip an astronomical cross-product number.
- Substitution failures (e.g. multi-line widget call definitions)
  surface as a clear `BuildReport.warnings` entry instead of
  silently skipping. Authors get told which widget couldn't be
  precomputed and why.

### Changed

- `precompute_page()` signature: takes `candidates: list[WidgetCandidate]`
  instead of a single candidate. Single-widget callers pass a
  one-element list; behaviour matches v0.1.0a5 for the 1-widget case.
- Per-widget script blocks (`<script class="marimo-book-precompute-widget">`,
  `<script class="marimo-book-precompute-table">`) and control mounts
  (`<div class="marimo-book-precompute-control">`) now carry a
  `data-precompute-widget="varname"` attribute used to pair them on
  multi-widget pages.
- Reactive cells gain a `data-precompute-widget="varname"` attribute
  alongside `data-precompute-cell="N"` so the JS shim limits swaps
  to cells controlled by the changed widget.

### Validated on dartbrains

Cache (v0.1.0a4) gives a **31× speedup** on dartbrains warm rebuild
(107s cold → 3.4s warm; 20 notebooks all cache-hit). Multi-widget
independent works on simple cases; on dartbrains specifically, 4 of
4 widget-heavy chapters either trip the disjointness check (joint
widgets, deferred to v2) or have value counts above the default cap.
The unlock for dartbrains will be **joint multi-widget cross-products**
(deferred), and **multi-line widget call support** for chapters like
ICA.

## [0.1.0a5] — 2026-04-25

Static reactivity for marimo's discrete UI widgets ships in two
PRs (#6 + #7). Authors enable `precompute.enabled: true` in `book.yml`
and discrete widgets (`mo.ui.slider(steps=[...])`,
`mo.ui.dropdown(options=[...])`, `mo.ui.switch()`,
`mo.ui.checkbox()`, `mo.ui.radio(options=[...])`) get real
client-side interactivity backed by build-time per-value rendering —
no Python kernel at runtime. Caps cap compute time and bundle size;
v1 supports single-widget pages.

### Added — static reactivity execution (2/2)

- Per-value re-export pipeline: when `precompute.enabled: true` and a
  page has a single discrete-widget candidate, the preprocessor runs
  `marimo export ipynb` once per non-default value (substituting the
  widget's `value=` via AST surgery in a temp source), captures
  per-cell HTML, and stores the diff against the base render as a
  JSON lookup table embedded in the page.
- `max_seconds_per_page` cap is now wall-clock-enforced: the first
  re-export's runtime is extrapolated; if projected total exceeds the
  budget, remaining values are skipped and the page renders static.
- `max_bytes_per_page` cap is now byte-enforced after each combination
  is captured.
- Reactive cells (those whose output differs across at least one value)
  are wrapped in `<div class="marimo-book-precompute-cell" ...>` for
  client-side targeting. Cells whose output is identical across all
  values are not stored — bundle stays bounded by what actually changes.
- Client-side JS shim (`assets/marimo_book.js`): renders the input
  control (range slider, select, or checkbox depending on widget kind),
  reads the embedded lookup table, and swaps reactive cell HTML on
  input — smooth, no page reflow, headers/sidebar/scroll position all
  preserved.
- New CSS for `.marimo-book-precompute-control` and the input controls
  (Material-themed, accent-coloured slider, tabular-numerics for the
  value label).
- New "Static reactivity" section in `docs/content/building.md`
  documenting the feature, the detection rules, the caps, and the v1
  limitations (single-widget pages only, Path-X execution path).
- New live demo chapter at `docs/content/precompute_demo.py` —
  temperature-conversion slider that swaps a Markdown table per value.
  Visible at `Authoring → Static reactivity demo` on the docs site
  with `precompute.enabled: true`.
- `Preprocessing OK` summary now reports precompute counts:
  `(14 pages, 13 rendered, 0 cached, 1 precomputed, 0 skipped)`.
- v1 limitation: multi-widget pages render every widget static with a
  warning. Multi-widget cross-products + Path-Y subgraph re-execution
  are deferred to v2 / when WASM render mode lands.

### Added — static reactivity foundation (1/2)

- `book.yml` `precompute` block (off by default) — opt-in static
  reactivity for discrete marimo UI widgets. Five fields:
  `enabled`, `max_values_per_widget` (default 50),
  `max_combinations_per_page` (200), `max_seconds_per_page` (60),
  `max_bytes_per_page` (10 MB), `exclude_pages` ([]).
- AST scanner (`src/marimo_book/transforms/precompute.py`) that finds
  precompute candidates without executing the notebook. Recognises:
  `mo.ui.slider(steps=[...])`, `mo.ui.slider(start, stop, step=N)`
  (or 3 positional args), `mo.ui.dropdown(options=[...])`,
  `mo.ui.dropdown(options={...})`, `mo.ui.switch()`, `mo.ui.checkbox()`,
  `mo.ui.radio(options=[...])`. Continuous sliders without an explicit
  step are deliberately skipped (render static). Non-literal arguments
  (`mo.ui.dropdown(options=opts)`) are skipped — value sets must be
  statically extractable.
- Preprocessor preview pass: when `precompute.enabled: true`, every
  `.py` page is scanned, count caps are applied, and over-cap widgets
  are recorded as `BuildReport.warnings` ("rendered static") with the
  page + widget name + which cap was hit. `BuildReport` gains
  `widgets_precomputed` / `widgets_skipped` counters.
- Build cache `_book_signature` now includes the `precompute` block,
  so toggling the flag invalidates rendered notebooks correctly.

This is the foundation only — the actual per-value re-export pipeline
+ client-side JS swap shim ship in the next PR. Until that lands,
`widgets_precomputed` is a *would-precompute* count: useful for tuning
caps before paying for execution.

## [0.1.0a4] — 2026-04-25

Build-cache + PDF + docs release. Cuts repeat-build time on books
with non-trivial notebooks (the dartbrains use case) from minutes to
seconds.

### Added

- **Incremental build cache.** The preprocessor now caches `marimo
  export ipynb` outputs at `{book_root}/.marimo_book_cache/manifest.json`
  keyed by source content hash, marimo-book version, and relevant
  `book.yml` fields (`widget_defaults`, `defaults`, `dependencies`,
  `launch_buttons`, `repo`, `branch`, `toc`). Subsequent builds skip
  notebooks whose source hasn't changed. Typical edit-one-chapter
  rebuild on a 20-notebook book drops from "every notebook" to "only
  the edited one". Markdown entries are not cached (10 ms each, not
  worth the bookkeeping).
- `marimo-book build --rebuild` and `marimo-book serve --rebuild` —
  bypass the cache for the current invocation. Use when you changed
  something the cache can't detect (data file the notebook reads,
  env-mode dep upgrade). `--clean` continues to wipe `_site_src/` and
  now also wipes `.marimo_book_cache/`, which has the same effect.
- Build summary line now reports cache stats:
  `Preprocessing OK (13 pages, 11 rendered, 1 cached at _site_src).`
- `book.yml` `pdf_export: bool` flag — when true, emits the
  `mkdocs-with-pdf` plugin so the build produces a single
  `_site/pdf/book.pdf` rendered through WeasyPrint, with a "Download
  PDF" link injected into the footer. Cover metadata (title,
  subtitle, author, copyright) inherits from existing `book.yml`
  fields. Requires the new `marimo-book[pdf]` extra; needs the same
  `libcairo2` / `libpango` system deps as `social_cards`.
- New "Building" page in the docs (`content/building.md`) — full
  reference covering the two-stage build pipeline, every CLI command
  with all flags, the five opt-in feature flags with their extras,
  the `_site_src/` and `_site/` output layouts, an ePub recipe via
  pandoc, and approximate build-performance numbers. Now also covers
  the build cache + invalidation rules.

## [0.1.0a3] — 2026-04-25

Visual + authoring overhaul plus a release-flow modernisation.

### Added

- `book.yml` `cross_references: bool` flag opts into the
  `mkdocs-autorefs` plugin so authors can write `[Heading text][]` and
  have it resolve to whatever page has that heading — the MkDocs analog
  of MyST `{ref}`. Requires the new `marimo-book[autorefs]` extra.
- `book.yml` `include_changelog: bool` flag — when true, the
  preprocessor copies `CHANGELOG.md` from the book root into the staged
  docs tree and appends a "Changelog" entry to the nav. Single source
  of truth: the same file PyPI links to also becomes a docs page.
- Default stylesheet (`assets/extra.css`) modernized: zinc neutrals,
  near-black dark scheme (`#0a0a0a`), Geist Sans + Geist Mono via
  `theme.font`, indigo accent on h1 / header title, uppercase tracked
  section labels in left sidebar + right TOC, hairline footer that
  matches page bg in both schemes. Carries forward to zensical.
- README badges (PyPI version, Python versions, CI, License, Docs).
- Live admonition / math / table / code examples on the Authoring page.
- Cross-references documentation on the Authoring page (page-to-page,
  anchors, abbreviations, snippets, autorefs).
- `release-drafter` workflow + config — every merged PR updates a
  draft GitHub Release; tagging publishes it. Categorises by PR label
  (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Documentation / Build & CI).

### Changed

- **Versioning:** switched to `hatch-vcs` for dynamic versions derived
  from git tags. `pyproject.toml` no longer carries a hard-coded
  `version`; tagging `v0.1.0a3` is sufficient to publish a wheel
  versioned `0.1.0a3`. `src/marimo_book/__init__.py` reads
  `__version__` via `importlib.metadata`. Eliminates the version-skew
  bug class (3 files no longer need to stay in sync per release).
- `PUBLISHING.md` rewritten around the new flow: tag-driven release,
  optional CHANGELOG-date PR, release-drafter populating release notes.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** MyST migration transforms (`{download}` role rewrite,
  `:::{glossary}` fence stripping). marimo-book now uses Material's
  Markdown dialect exclusively. Books written for marimo-book have
  always used Material syntax (`!!! note` admonitions, `[label](page.md)`
  links); the removed transforms only affected content ported from
  Jupyter Book. To migrate: replace `{download}\`text <path>\`` with
  `[text](path)` and remove `:::{glossary}` / `:::` fence markers (the
  inner definition lists pass through Material's `def_list` natively).

## [0.1.0a2] — 2026-04-24

Metadata + ergonomics pass on top of 0.1.0a1.

### Added

- `book.yml` gains two fields:
  - `url` — canonical public URL, emitted as mkdocs `site_url` so the
    social plugin and sitemap.xml get fully-qualified paths.
  - `social_cards: bool` — opts into Material's `social` plugin for
    auto-generated OpenGraph / Twitter preview images per page. Requires
    the new `marimo-book[social]` extra (`pip install
    'marimo-book[social]'`) which pulls `mkdocs-material[imaging]` +
    Pillow + cairosvg.
- `pyproject.toml` `Documentation` project URL now links directly to
  the docs site, so PyPI's sidebar gains a "Documentation" link in
  addition to Repository / Issues / Changelog.

### Changed

- CI + docs deploy workflows install `libcairo2` / `libpango` on
  Ubuntu so the social plugin's SVG→PNG rendering works.

### Fixed

- `info.license` still reports `None` on pypi.org JSON API (this is a
  Warehouse-side transition from `License` → `License-Expression` per
  PEP 639). The real PyPI page and the wheel METADATA both report MIT
  correctly.

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-04-24

First alpha release. Usable end-to-end for single-book sites.

### Added

**CLI** (`marimo-book ...`)

- `new <dir>` — scaffold a new book (book.yml, content/, .gitignore,
  .github/workflows/deploy.yml, README). `--force` to write into
  non-empty directories.
- `build` — preprocess + emit static site to `_site/`. `--strict` fails
  on warnings; `--clean` blows away prior build artifacts first.
- `serve` — dev server with live reload. Runs an initial build, spawns
  `mkdocs serve`, and a watchdog observer rebuilds on changes to
  `content/` or `book.yml`.
- `check` — validate `book.yml` + referenced files without building.
- `clean` — remove `_site/`, `_site_src/`, `.marimo_book_cache/`.

**Config** (`book.yml`)

- Pydantic v2 schema with readable errors for unknown keys.
- Discriminated-union TOC (`file:` / `url:` / `section:` + `children:`).
- Author metadata, branding (logo, favicon, palette, fonts), launch
  buttons, bibliography paths, analytics (Plausible / Google), per-page
  render defaults, per-widget-class default state.
- Top-level `shell:` reserved for future `zensical` / `jinja` targets.

**Preprocessor transforms**

- `marimo_export` — `.py` → Markdown + inline HTML via
  `marimo export ipynb --include-outputs`. Handles hide_code, mime bundles
  (text/html, text/markdown, image/png|jpeg|svg+xml, text/plain,
  streams, errors), and first-setup-cell elision.
- `callouts` — `<marimo-callout-output>` → Material admonition with the
  kind mapped (info/note/success/tip/warning/danger/failure/neutral).
- `anywidgets` — `<marimo-anywidget>` → `<div class="marimo-book-anywidget">`
  mount; AST-walks cell source to extract literal widget kwargs; merges
  with `book.yml` `widget_defaults`. Strips
  `<marimo-ui-element>` / `<marimo-slider>` / etc. wrappers around
  kernel-dependent controls that have no static analog.
- `md_roles` — `{download}\`label <path>\`` → `[label](path)`;
  `:::{glossary}` fence stripping.
- `link_rewrites` — `.ipynb` cross-refs → `.md` (when target exists);
  `../images/` → `images/` in both Markdown links and HTML attrs.

**Shell generator**

- `book.yml` → `mkdocs.yml` with Material theme, standard pymdownx
  extensions (arithmatex, admonition, blocks, details, highlight,
  superfences, tabbed, tasklist), sensible nav feature flags, and an
  `extra.css` derived from the book's palette.

**Runtime shim** (`assets/marimo_book.js`)

- Minimal anywidget-compatible model loader. At page load, finds every
  `.marimo-book-anywidget` mount, decodes the inlined ES module from
  `data-js-url`, and calls `module.default.render({model, el})` with a
  seeded model. Works with Material's instant-navigation via
  `document$.subscribe`.

### Verified

- Full test suite: 46 passing across config, transforms, CLI, and watcher.
- End-to-end dartbrains build (34 TOC entries, 20 marimo notebooks):
  0 preprocessor errors, 2 cosmetic mkdocs warnings (both broken-link
  issues in dartbrains source content, not tool bugs).
- Widget-heavy chapter (MR_Physics.py, 9 anywidgets) renders and animates
  in a browser without marimo's frontend runtime.

### Known limitations

- No WASM / hybrid render modes yet (static only).
- No dependency-graph-aware incremental cache; every rebuild is a full
  rebuild.
- MyST cross-refs with `{ref}`, `{numref}`, `{eq}`, `{cite}`, etc. are
  stripped through unchanged (no usage in any book we've migrated yet).
- Material for MkDocs is entering maintenance mode in ~12 months;
  `marimo-book` is explicitly designed to port to [zensical](https://zensical.org)
  when it stabilises (same `mkdocs.yml`, different build command).
